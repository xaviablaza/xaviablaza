# Xavi Ablazaâ€”@xaviablaza
Hi, I'm Xavi!

ðŸŒ‡ By day, I'm a software engineer at [Touch of Modern](https://www.touchofmodern.com/), a curated, online shopping destination for men to discover extraordinary products to elevate their lifestyle.

ðŸŒƒ By night, I build SaaS products at my companies in the Philippines. My 1st company, [Makisu](https://makisu.co/) focuses on HR & administration tech. My 2nd company, [Hostari](https://hostari.com/) raised a pre-seed round of $300K at a $3.5MM valuation and focuses on game server configuration. I lead a team of 15 incredibly talented people across product, operations, and marketing in the Philippines, all working fully remote. We've reached $110K ARR as of April 7, 2022 and launched March 31, 2021.

Previously, I led consultancy efforts at the [User Experience Society](https://uxsociety.org). Before that, I worked in fintech at [Bloom Solutions](https://bloom.solutions) focusing on blockchain-powered money remittance.

## What I'm good at
- Mentoring engineers on how to be _practical_ when it comes to coding
- Fostering entrepreneurial & critical thinking when building software products
- Interviewing and negotiation strategies when going into your first job in tech
