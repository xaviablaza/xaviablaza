# Xavi Ablazaâ€”@xaviablaza
Hi, I'm Xavi!

ðŸŒ‡ By day, I'm a software engineer at [Touch of Modern](https://www.touchofmodern.com/), a curated, online shopping destination for men to discover extraordinary products to elevate their lifestyle.

ðŸŒƒ By night, I build SaaS products at my company [Makisu](https://makisu.co/), with the help of my amazing product & operations team in the Philippines. I've built software in the productized services and game server hosting spaces. I'd like to build for the creator economy & crypto (again) one day.

Previously, I led consultancy efforts at the [User Experience Society](https://uxsociety.org). Before that, I worked in fintech at [Bloom Solutions](https://bloom.solutions) focusing on blockchain-powered money remittance./

## What I'm good at
- Mentoring engineers on how to be _practical_ when it comes to coding
- Fostering entrepreneurial & critical thinking when building software products
- Interviewing and negotiation strategies when going into your first job in tech

## What I've learned from my mentors
- In 2018, I became a $BTC maxi (and still continue to be a maxi until today), which shaped my views on personal finance
- In 2019, I applied to 600 jobs that converted into 1 job offer and learned to always bet and invest in myself
- In 2020, I learned that a business can spend as much as it earns as long as it grows. Also became a fan of bootstrapping and debt financing.
- In 2021, I saw how loyalties can change when working in a company and how some people genuinely don't care about team growth
